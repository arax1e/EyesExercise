# EyesExercise
## About the Project
This program uses a combination of HTML, Javascript, and CSS to create a pair of eyes with pupils that move based on the movement of the mouse. This is a practice activity for MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN. This exercise is a tool to practice manipulating styles using CSS, and creating dynamic movement in the browser. 

## How to Run
To run this page, you can navigate to it through GitHub pages at https://arax1e.github.io/EyesExercise/, and you will find the eyes which move with the motion of your mouse. 

## What's Next
In future updates, I will add features to make the background change color, and create a function that can stop the motion of the eyes.

This program was made with files from MIT x Pro's course. More information can be found in the LICENSE file.
